Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.4.repo file so that you can install MongoDB directly, using yum.
Use the following repository file:

[mongodb-org-3.4]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.4.asc


To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following command:

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org


Start MongoDB.
You can start the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo service mongod start


Verify that MongoDB has started successfully
You can verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at

where <port> is the port configured in /etc/mongod.conf, 27017 by default.

You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:
